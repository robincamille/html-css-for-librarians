### 1_basic-html/

A super-basic HTML file containing tags like `<a>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, and `<ul>`. 

### 2_basic-css/

An HTML file with an internal CSS stylesheet that contains basic properties like `font-size`, `background-color`, and `margin`.

### 3_classes-and-ids/

An HTML file with an internal CSS stylesheet that contains examples of `class` and `id`. (I added this after the workshop to make the examples clearer.)


### 4_libguide/ 

For blanket customization that will affect all LibGuides. An HTML file (one page taken directly from John Jay's LibGuides) and an external CSS stylesheet. 

Modify only the stylesheet (`custom.css`) for this exercise. Stylesheet revised to reflect current LibGuides `class`es and `id`s.


### 5_blank/ 

A blank HTML file and external CSS stylesheet. They contain a starter template for you to fill with whatever your heart desires.

## Just need code to copy & paste into one blog post, LibGuide box, etc.? 

Use **inline css** to change CSS on the fly.

For example, to change the color of a link:

`<a href="http://cuny.edu/" style="color:orange; font-size:20px;">Link example</a>`

To make an image shrink to 100px wide, align to the left, and have the text flow around it, with some space between the image and text:

`<img src="xyz.jpg" alt="XYZ" style="width:100px; height:auto; float:left; margin-right:20px; margin-bottom:20px;">`

## Troubleshooting

Be sure to save and fully unzip (extract) *all* the files from the .zip you downloaded. Otherwise you'll get a lot of funny symbols in the files when you look at them in Notepad.

Are the .html and .css files showing up as a big text blob in Notepad? A quick workaround is to copy & paste all the code from the file into Word, then copy & paste it back into the original file in Notepad.
